First, run ```bash setup.sh```

This should download and build all the things necessary to use pocketsphinx

To test pocketsphinx for phoneme extraction, try the following command

```bash ps_shortcut.sh apple.wav```

Note, this file *must* be 16kHz. You can perform this conversion using sox, like

```sox in.wav -b 16 out.wav rate 16k```
